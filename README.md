# CitySurfer
CURRENT KNOWN BUG
New users are unable to edit anything.
This is because previously Firebase was creating two accounts per signup. I tried to remove it but it broke new users. Will be fixed soon.
In a new city and want to make a local friend while also getting a view of the unique delights and customs of the city? CitySurfer is an app that can match you with locals who you can spend a day with.

How it works (hopefully :D):
1. You can plan these in advance of up to 2 weeks before.
2. Get matched with a local guide.
3. The local guide can accept or decline.
4. Message your guide with what you would like to do, and learn about each other!
5. Explore the city together!
6. Leave a review for your guide and your guide will leave one for you!
7. If you loved it, maybe schedule another one!
